# AssemblyPrograming

this project contains two versions.

Final_No_Input:
contains a working project as tested in the documentation attached with the project. however, it is using a predifined input for each of the field rather than the full sentence.

Final_Input:
contains a version of the project that segfaults. in this trial, i tried to get input from the user via terminal. 

Each folder contains a readme.txt in which i have written the compilation command for each of them.
